Support HTML or jade templating on client side</h2>\n<p>You can use any template engine for client side but by default the generator works with HTML and Jade. I don't really like Jade too much so I always try to use EJS or similar (<em>Warning this last sentence is the author's opinion</em>).</p>\n<h2>6.

As with any other technology ecosystem, the great number of frameworks, libraries and tools can make our choice a challenge, and JavaScript is not an exception. But for JavaScript projects we have lot of help and I decide to use the awesome Yeoman tool. Yeoman combines the power of grunt, bower, npm and adds its own salt: the generators. Yeoman generators are tasks responsible to build the initial project scaffolding. Yeoman offers an extensive set of official generators oriented to create: webapps, backbone app, chrome extension, etc but we can also found a myriad of non official generators (yes, because anyone can create a new generator to satisfy his/her needs). Within all the generators I chose angular-fullstack to create my MEAN project structure and next are my reasons: 1. Easy to install You require to have node and npm installed on your system. Once you have them installYeoman and the angular-fullstack is as easy as: Once installed the generator you simply need to create a new folder and initialise your project: {% highlight bash %} mkdir my-new-project && cd $_\nyo angular-fullstack app-name\n{% endhighlight %} 2. Creates both client and server scaffoldings The generator generates the full stack of your project, both the client and server code. Your project will start well organised and prepared to create an awesome RIA application. 3. Introduces good practices in the generated code Because the generated is made by experienced developers, they applies good practices in code organisation and style programming (like the environment configuration on the server side using node). For me, this is one of the most important reasons to use this generator. Anybody knows starting with a new technology is always hard, but it is nothing when you start with four new technologies :) 4.
