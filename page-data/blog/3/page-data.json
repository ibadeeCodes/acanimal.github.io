Its 18:15h while writing these lines. Looking back to this year lot of feelings mixes in my mind, some of them great and some sad. But live continues and we can only go forward.

JSON format is mainly used on REST APIs because it is easy to read by JavaScript  (JSON means JavaScript Object Notation) allowing to develop client side application. In Java and, similarly to the old days of XML, we have different ways to read JSON files: object model or streaming way. No one is better than other, they are simply designed for different needs and situations. The object model way works loading the whole file in…"}},{"node":{"id":"d5227f15-289f-5045-a57e-57c8db96ae53","frontmatter":{"title":"Webpack, not another task runner tool","date":"15 October, 2015","layout":"post"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2015/10/15/webpack-not-another-task-runner-tool/","readingTime":{"text":"2 min read"}},"excerpt":"It seems we are living an gold era about JavaScript and front end world with a myriad of frameworks, language improvements and, what is related to this article, build systems, tasks runner or whatever you want to call them.\nWe have adepts to Grunt, firm believers of Gulp or purists preferring the use of old fashion npm scripts way. Well, I'm sorry for all of you but there is a new kid on the block and it is (IMO) a really strong competitor. It's name is webpack and it is a module bundler.

Because of this, some days ago I started working on an implementation of the specification pattern for NodeJS. The code is freely available at github repository and also installable via npmjs.
