Yes, I didn't write \"spent some time\" because your time understanding how to work with OpenLayers3 is not wasted time, but an investment in a new and very powerful tool.</p>\n<h2>The content</h2>\n<p>I tried to organise the book chapters in a natural order to understand the new architecture. Each chapter has a first section where all the theory is explained and a second one, based on examples, where you can see those concepts in action.</p>\n<h3>Chapters</h3>\n<p>Next is the table of contents.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Map and the View</li>\n<li>Layers</li>\n<li>Data sources and formats</li>\n<li>Vector layers</li>\n<li>Events, listeners and properties</li>\n<li>Overlays</li>\n<li>Controls and Interactions</li>\n</ul>\n<h3> Where can you find it?</h3>\n<p>The book has been written with the awesome <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/\">LeanPub</a> platform. Its slogan is <em>Publish Early, Publish Often</em> and I think I didn't follow too much it. Because of this I want to make a pre-relase, to see the readers acceptance, get your feedback and know if all this effort worthwhile.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/\">LeanPub</a> platform, once you buy a book you are allowed to download its updates freely. I will notify you when new releases are available.</p>\n<p>Please let me know everything: from mistakes in my sentences or code to costs (is it expensive or has an acceptable cost).</p>","excerpt":"I don't remember when I start writing, I think the 2014 christmas, but what I know for sure is these months were a really busy months.
