Hopefully, the awesome people at AirBnB have created the <a href=\"https://github.com/airbnb/javascript\">AirBnB JavaScript Style Guide</a> for us that I have chose because of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Works with ES5 and ES6: arrow functions, object destructuring, array spread, ...</li>\n<li>Includes React and JSX style: one component per file, recognizes stateless vs class component, ...</li>\n<li>It is based on ESLint.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>I want to note here the <a href=\"http://standardjs.com\">Standard JS</a> project</strong>, which defines a set of <a href=\"http://standardjs.com/rules.html\">rules</a> ready to be used in our JS projects. Related with what I have said in the previous section, I want to highlight two sentences written in the main page of the project:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This module saves you (and others!) time in two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No configuration. The easiest way to enforce consistent style in your project. Just drop it in.</li>\n<li>Catch style errors before they're submitted in PRs. Saves precious code review time by eliminating back-and-forth between maintainer and contributor.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Integrating ESLint with Atom</h2>\n<p>Ok, enough talk and lets start working. We need to make two things: first, configure ESLint in our project (for this we also need to install the AirBnB style guide), and second install necessary Atom plugins to show messages while coding.</p>\n<h3>Configuring ESLint in your project</h3>\n<p>The first thing we need to do is configure ESLint in our project. Remember we are going to use the AirBnB style guide so we need no install the required package and make our ESLint configuration extend from the AirBnB ESLint configuration.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Install ESLint locally to your project: <code class=\"language-text\">&gt; npm install eslint --save-dev</code>.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Install the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb\">AirBnB ESLint configuration</a>. Following package instructions we need to execute next sentences to install the right package versions and dependencies:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-bash line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token operator\">></span> <span class=\"token function\">export</span> PKG<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>eslint-config-airbnb<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">></span> <span class=\"token function\">npm</span> info <span class=\"token string\">\"<span class=\"token variable\">$PKG</span>\"</span> peerDependencies --json <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token function\">command</span> <span class=\"token function\">sed</span> <span class=\"token string\">'s/[\\{\\},]//g ; s/: /@/g'</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token function\">xargs</span> <span class=\"token function\">npm</span> <span class=\"token function\">install</span> --save-dev <span class=\"token string\">\"<span class=\"token variable\">$PKG</span>\"</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n</li>\n<li>Create a <code class=\"language-text\">.eslintrc</code> file in the root of our project.
