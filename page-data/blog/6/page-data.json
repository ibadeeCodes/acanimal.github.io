Its is not a mechanical process, it is more related with inspiration, but we must be constant and productive. Everyday is not the best day to write It is a fact, a law of universe. You could desire write but some days your brain is not clear enough, agile enough, fresh enough to write as you like. Don't force yourself. Don't hate yourself to be unable to write as you would like. Relax. Disconnect. Put your head in another tasks. Do some sport. The best thing to do when today isn't the best day to write is not to write. Markdown notation is great Yes, markdown syntax is great. It is simple, clear and powerful. At the beginning, if you come from a complex word processor like Word, Pages, LibreOffice or similar, you feel nude, but later you will appreciate that nudity. Markdown separates your raw writes from the final visualisation. A text editor is enough People tend to drown looking for the perfect tool to make the work. My advice is don't bother you, a simple text editor is enough to write any kind of book (otherwise ask to the hundreds of people that have written using a typewriter). Personally, I prefer a simple text editor over a word processor, because the first isolates the content from the way to visualise it. Of course technology can improve the way we work. We have tons of text editor, classics like vim or emacs text editors, the new ones like SublimeText, TextMate or the Ulysses application, and also, many online text editors, like dillinger.io or StackEdit. Keep cross references organized Some kind of books, like technical books, are plenty of cross references pointing to other sections, chapters or samples. It is vital for the author to maintain these references updated and organized. When using markdown a tend to organize the book as follows: Each chapter in a separate file named  Put a reference on each chapter title like:  Put a reference on each section title as  These simple tips help you organize the whole book references and simplifying the process to create cross references."}},{"node":{"id":"45cb9408-4876-5649-b2cb-c1428ed166fb","frontmatter":{"title":"New Overlays chapter on The Book of OpenLayers3","date":"02 November, 2014","layout":"post"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2014/11/02/new-overlays-chapter-on-the-book-of-openlayers3/","readingTime":{"text":"1 min read"}},"excerpt":"The Book of OpenLayers 3 has been updated !!! This book is self-published, no great editorial is behind it neither a marketing campaign, so I appreciate any shares you can make through social networks and any other media. What you can find in this new update? A new Overlays chapter. This is a short but necessary chapter that explains how we can work with overlays to place any kind of HTML located within the map. As I comment, it is a short chapter but I prefer to leave it as an independent chapter. A new sample on the Events, listeners and properties chapter, named Styling features under the pointer. Once we know about feature styling and events, the sample demonstrates how we can change the style of the features under the pointer. The book has now 6 chapters and is 80% complete. Currently I continue working on a more extensive chapter called Controls and Interactions, which I hope to have finished in approximately a month. Please, don't hesitate to contact me with comments and suggestions. Your feedback is really valuable for me.

As with any other technology ecosystem, the great number of frameworks, libraries and tools can make our choice a challenge, and JavaScript is not an exception. But for JavaScript projects we have lot of help and I decide to use the awesome Yeoman tool. Yeoman combines the power of grunt, bower, npm and adds its own salt: the generators. Yeoman generators are tasks responsible to build the initial project scaffolding. Yeoman offers an extensive set of official generators oriented to create: webapps, backbone app, chrome extension, etc but we can also found a myriad of non official generators (yes, because anyone can create a new generator to satisfy his/her needs). Within all the generators I chose angular-fullstack to create my MEAN project structure and next are my reasons: 1. Easy to install You require to have node and npm installed on your system. Once you have them installYeoman and the angular-fullstack is as easy as: Once installed the generator you simply need to create a new folder and initialise your project: {% highlight bash %} mkdir my-new-project && cd $_\nyo angular-fullstack app-name\n{% endhighlight %} 2. Creates both client and server scaffoldings The generator generates the full stack of your project, both the client and server code. Your project will start well organised and prepared to create an awesome RIA application. 3. Introduces good practices in the generated code Because the generated is made by experienced developers, they applies good practices in code organisation and style programming (like the environment configuration on the server side using node). For me, this is one of the most important reasons to use this generator. Anybody knows starting with a new technology is always hard, but it is nothing when you start with four new technologies :) 4. Server side API prepared to use authentication Following best practices the code is prepared so you can easily add security to you API via a node middleware so each request requires authentication of the client side. 5. Support HTML or jade templating on client side You can use any template engine for client side but by default the generator works with HTML and Jade. I don't really like Jade too much so I always try to use EJS or similar (Warning this last sentence is the author's opinion). 6. Support for different CSS preprocessors For different opinions there are different alternatives. This way angular-fullstack has support for plain CSS, Stylus, Sass or LESS pre-processors. Choose your preferred. 7. Commands to scaffold anything With theangular-fullstack you can create new end points for the server side or client side components (like routes, controllers, services, filters, directives, ...) with a sentences. So, next command: {% highlight bash %} yo angular-fullstack:endpoint message\n? What will the url of your endpoint to be? /api/messages\n{% endhighlight %} will produce: {% highlight bash %}\nserver/api/message/index.js\nserver/api/message/message.spec.js\nserver/api/message/message.controller.js\nserver/api/message/message.model.js  (optional)\nserver/api/message/message.socket.js (optional)\n{% endhighlight %}  Conclusion In my opinion, angular-fullstack is a really powerful tool that simplifies our day to day work. As always it is not the panacea, it is simply a generic tool to automatize many common tasks. Because of this we can found situations it lacks some feature."}},{"node":{"id":"181d8a9a-f393-596e-8131-44c64dc28a94","frontmatter":{"title":"The Book of OpenLayers 3, released !!!","date":"08 October, 2014","layout":"post"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2014/10/08/the-book-of-openlayers-3-released/","readingTime":{"text":"2 min read"}},"excerpt":"Finally I completed most of the chapters I had thought for the book.

The Book of OpenLayers3 is progressing well. It is not finished but I would like to notify you, in the next weeks, I will launch a pre-release of the book. At this moment the book contains five chapters covering the most important topics of the new architecture and design of the library. All chapters are divided in a theory section, where I explain all the concepts and involved classes, and a practice section, where I show real working examples. Remember, all the examples are also freely available at the GitHub repository: https://github.com/acanimal/thebookofopenlayers3 are right now running at: http://www.acuriousanimal.com/thebookofopenlayers3. My intention is continue writing, at least, two more chapters. One dedicated to the controls OpenLayers3 offers to interact with the map, and a second one, related to the concept of overlays. I hope to cover these two chapter in one month. Thanks to LeanPub platform, once you buy a book you are allowed to download the new updates freely. I will notify you when new releases are available. Please, do not hesitate to send me your feedback related with the book, from its content to its costs. Finally, remember this book is self published, no great publishing company is behind it and no great marketing campaigns are organised, so any comments on shared networks that publicise the book will be appreciated.

Least but not last you need time. Time to see the source code and learn. Time to see the examples and learn. Time to understand all the concepts and learn. Time to explain in your words what you have learnt. Today, I announced the links where you can find the online samples and code repository for The book of OpenLayers3. Code repository is open, so don't hesitate to download and contribute with new samples. The work is not complete, I need to finish the theory part of a chapter related to vector information and write two more chapters I have in mind and, of course, create some samples to see the theory in practice. I will write another post introducing the book with a more in depth chapter description. This post is only about the code samples. Your feedback is really valuable for me !!!  About the code samples For those interested in contribute, the project for the code samples is built using the Yeoman tool, which combines Grunt and Bower, and the generator for web application , which offers a project skeleton with a bunch of good practices. In addition to the default plugins used by the generator, I made use of the Grunt's plugin  (see here) that implement like PHP include directive. This way, I can create a page layout (with headers, footers, etc) reusable for all the pages. See the  file for more details about plugins. For the implementation I made use of the Bootstrap framework, the nice Yeti theme from Bootswatch project and the highlight.js project to highlight the samples code. See more details of project dependencies in the  file."}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"limit":6,"skip":30,"numPages":18,"currentPage":6}}}
