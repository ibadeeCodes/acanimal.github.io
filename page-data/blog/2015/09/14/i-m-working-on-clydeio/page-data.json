It is extremely flexibly, configurable and simply to extend. It is designed to simplify the development of new APIs (or simply improving existing ones) adding authentication, logging, rate limiting, etc. Note, the project is currently a proof of concept (I'm currently working to apply it in a real system) and most of the developed filters are basic implementation to demonstrate its usefulness. What is an API gateway and why I need one? The most important part when designing and implementing an API is to model your business correctly and offer a set of well defined operations accordingly with them. Unfortunately, that is only an small part of the job and it is not enough to ensure the success. As a real World system you require to secure your API, store logs, apply rate limits, etc. The task of publishing an API becomes much more complex than understanding your business, you have entered the world of security, monitoring and... the unknown !!! An API gateway is a single point of entry responsible to apply actions (like security or logging) before redirecting the request to your real-do-the-job API. We can see the gateway as a kind (or mix) of firewall and proxy and is really useful implementing microservices.  Thanks to ClydeIO you can spend your efforts implementing your business API leaving the rest of things to the gateway. The glory of ClydeIO is its simplicity and its easy to extent with new filters like: Secure an existent API Log access to any resource Rate limiting Filter request (allow/deny) depending on the query parameters Cache data or whatever you need  Because it is based on node we can use the myriad of awesome node packages out there and integrate within your filters.  Why a new system instead contribute to an existent one? I was looking for similar projects before start ClydeIO. There is plenty of services that provides same functionalities (and many more) as well as many projects with a great maturity level, but no one satisfies my needs. Services implies a cost for its usage that, sometimes, can be hard to calculate and in some cases requires you adapt your systems (your business API) to accommodate to the service requirements.
