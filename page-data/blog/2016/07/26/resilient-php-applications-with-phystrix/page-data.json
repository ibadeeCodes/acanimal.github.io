You can see how this will avoid a cascade failure of our system. Hopefully, some years ago the Netflix engineers worked in a solution called Hystrix which is so good that has become one of the most famous tools when working with microservices in Java. Hystrix is a latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems, services and 3rd party libraries, stop cascading failure and enable resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is inevitable. Hystrix implements the circuit breaker pattern. Following the electrical circuits analogy, each dependency of our system to a third party service can be seen as a cable with an interruptor. While the communications with the third party works fine, the interruptor is closed (allowing flow the electricity), but when a problem is detected in the third party system (i.e due a timeout) the interruptor is opened making our system impossible to communicate with the third party, which makes our system fail quickly when a dependency fails. A robust solution for PHP After looking some libraries I finally decide to use Phystrix, a Hystrix port to PHP made by oDesk (now Upwork). Following Hystrix design, Phyxtrix requires all the actions we want to make against a third party service (querying a database, inserting into a queue, etc) must be encapsulated as a command (see the command pattern). The library offers and abstract command class from we can inherit when creating our commands. It is up to us to implement the  method responsible to make the real action (the call to a service, the insert into database, etc) and optionally the  method that returns a result if the third party is not available. The good part is each time a command is executed, the base command class collects metrics (like the number of failed call to a third party) and is responsible to manage the circuit state (open or close) depending on the current metric values. Note Phystrix stores all the metric in APC, so you should have this extension enabled. Additionally, the people from oDesk implemented two more tools: phystrix-bundle: A bundle for Symfony2 that can help us integrate Phystrix into our Symfony projects. phystrix-dashboard: Some classes that helps creating an endpoint in our application to serve the metrics stores by Phystrix. This endpoint can be added to the hystrix-dashboard tool to monitor our metrics in almost real time. hystrix-dashboard Conclusions Our systems has dependencies to other systems we can't control.
