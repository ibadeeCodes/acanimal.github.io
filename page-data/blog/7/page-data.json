Similarly, The book of OpenLayers3 follows a similar progress, always one or two steps after the project evolution. Currently, you can found a sample chapter about the Map and View, both theory and practice, and I have almost finished the next chapter focused on how to work with Layers. After explaining layers the natural flow is explain the Sources and Formats, which allows to load content from a great number of data sources. They are very related to layers, but I preferred to differentiate the concepts in two separated chapters. This is what I'm currently working on. What else requires to be in the book? I need to make a chapter focused on vector data, explain how to work with geometries, features and styles. Events are also important, we can listen for changes in objects and react accordingly. As you can see there are many work to be done yet and your feedback is the most valuable thing I can get at this moment."}},{"node":{"id":"8ea54c29-5d31-5d8e-9437-c9ee48021c76","frontmatter":{"title":"Randomatic, to generate random sequences","date":"27 January, 2014","layout":"post"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2014/01/27/randomatic-to-generate-random-sequences/","readingTime":{"text":"1 min read"}},"excerpt":"This is my own implementation of a tool to generate random character sequences: Ranomatic !!!

I will appreciate all your feedback, comments, ideas, ... The chapter is dedicated to two of the main concepts within the OpenLayers3, the map and the view. While in previous versions the map was the central piece that controls from layers or controls to the way the map is visualized, that is, the extension and projection to be used, in OpenLayers3 these responsibilities has been decouples. The map continues being responsible to contain layers, controls or (the new) overlays, but there is a new concept, the view, responsible to determine how the map is visualize. So the view is who determines the visible map extent, center location or projection. Take into account OpenLayers3 is in active development so things can vary slightly until the final release of OpenLayers3 and this book. Help me promoting the book and remember I'm waiting for your comments."}},{"node":{"id":"df625f78-e8a9-54a4-898b-c9ae12f3bad0","frontmatter":{"title":"SublimeText plugins for writing a book in markdown","date":"09 January, 2014","layout":"post"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2014/01/09/sublimetext-plugins-for-writing-a-book-in-markdown/","readingTime":{"text":"2 min read"}},"excerpt":"I'm currently involved on writing The book of OpenLayers3 using the great LeanPub platform.\n  LeanPub has many benefits (I should write a post some day talking about) and one of them are you write the book using the markdown notation (really a slightly extended dialect) and they generate automatically your book in PDF, ePub and mobi formats."}},{"node":{"id":"7a33fbad-be04-5476-9add-c07344a45c5f","frontmatter":{"title":"Feedback for The book of OpenLayers3","date":"02 January, 2014","layout":"post"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2014/01/02/feedback-for-the-book-of-openlayers3/","readingTime":{"text":"1 min read"}},"excerpt":"Finally I have decided to use LeanPub as the platform to publish my book.
