As many other times I wanted to use flash messages so, when user authentication fails, the application shows a message informing about bad credentials. Nothing new on the horizon until.... OMG !!! I can't see the flash messages !!! Disclaimer: This is a really stupid history with me as starring. I like to learn from my errors and because of this I decide to write this…"}},{"node":{"id":"58b3b0d9-2e87-5aba-9a5e-07a31150cf3c","frontmatter":{"title":"Reading/writing compressed and not compressed files in Java","date":"03 January, 2015","layout":"post"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2015/01/03/readingwriting-compressed-and-not-compressed-files-in-java/","readingTime":{"text":"3 min read"}},"excerpt":"Main reason for this post is trying don't repeat yourself (DRY) because, often, I fall in the recursive need to read and write compressed and not compressed files (mainly JSON and CSV). Let's to see first how to read text files. Note I'm working with (relatively small) text files so: The read methods returns an String with the whole content.

Maybe you, like me, has spent some time trying to understand why your GeoJSON data is not rendering properly: projection is fine, your GeoJSON is well formed and validated but OpenLayers3 doesn't return any features and so nothing is rendered in the map. What is the problem? The  class is a subclass of  that uses an  instance to read content: A source class, by definition…"}},{"node":{"id":"4ed4b2e9-45ac-587b-bdc1-e7702b80b6e8","frontmatter":{"title":"How the JavaScript heatmap implementation works?","date":"23 December, 2014","layout":"post"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2014/12/23/how-the-javascript-heatmap-implementation-works/","readingTime":{"text":"2 min read"}},"excerpt":"A heatmap is a powerful way to visualise data. Given a matrix of data each value is represented by a color. The implementation of the heatmap algorithm is expensive in computation terms: for each grid's pixel you need to compute its colour from a set of known values. As you can thing, it is not feasible to be implement it on the client side because map rendering would be really slow.  But OpenLayers3 comes with a handy class, , which allows to render vector data as a heatmap, so the question is…"}},{"node":{"id":"30b48605-7dd9-5bea-a16d-0e5748788a27","frontmatter":{"title":"The Book of OpenLayers 3, completed !!!","date":"16 December, 2014","layout":"post"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2014/12/16/the-book-of-openlayers-3-completed/","readingTime":{"text":"1 min read"}},"excerpt":"It was a long road but finally it comes true: The Book of OpenLayers 3 is finished.

Its is not a mechanical process, it is more related with inspiration, but we must be constant and productive. Everyday is not the best day to write It is a fact, a law of universe. You could desire write but some days your brain is not clear enough, agile enough, fresh enough to write as you like. Don't force yourself. Don't hate yourself to be unable to write as you would like. Relax…"}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"limit":6,"skip":24,"numPages":17,"currentPage":5}}}
