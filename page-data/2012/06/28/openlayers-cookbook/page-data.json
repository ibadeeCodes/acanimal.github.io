So I will try to get some time and write some of the <em>forgotten</em> recipes here for you.</p>\n<div>\n<h2>Who this book is for</h2>\n</div>\n<p>If you are a GIS-related professional with some basic knowledge of web technologies and want to start or gain in-depth knowledge of creating web mapping applications, this book is written for you.</p>\n<h2>The book</h2>\n<p>I like to consider the book an intermediate book where the reader can understand the basic concepts of a web mapping application and learn all the basic usages of OpenLayers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create maps, understand projection and other important properties</li>\n<li>Add raster and vector layers</li>\n<li>Work with important tile providers</li>\n<li>Work with OGCs WMS and WFS compliant servers</li>\n<li>Read/write features from/to different data sources</li>\n<li>Style features to improve their visualisation</li>\n<li>Understand events and work with the main controls</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have created the chapters in the appropriate order required to learn OpenLayers in a <em>natural</em> way and, for each chapter, I have written a set or recipes that shows the main and more common things required in a day to day job.</p>\n<h2>The writing</h2>\n<p>It has been a hard task to me to write this book. Think on the appropriate recipes, introduce concepts and code the samples takes me more time than I consider initially.</p>\n<p>As many other libraries, OpenLayers has plenty of classes with lots of properties and methods, so create specific recipes to show their usage and utility was not an easy task. Fortunately I count with a great team of professionals from PacktPublishing and a great group of reviewers ;)</p>\n<p>I can say by my experience writing a book, without to be a best seller author, is a purely vocational tasks. Hope I can repeat the experience.</p>","excerpt":"I'm near to finish my first experience as the author of a technical book.
