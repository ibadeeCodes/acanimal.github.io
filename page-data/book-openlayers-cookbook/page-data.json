It is for GIS-related professionals who have basic knowledge of web technologies, and wish to start or gain in-depth knowledge of creating web mapping applications.</p>\n<p>The book covers the main concepts about maps, layers, controls, protocols, events, important tile providers and WMS servers and is divided in the next set of chapters:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/openlayers-cookbook\"><img src=\"%7B%7B%20site.url%20%7D%7D%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/assets/uploads/7843OS_OpenLayer%20Cookbook_cov_0.jpg\" alt=\"openlayers-cookbook\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Chapter 1: Web Mapping Basics</em><br>\n<em>Chapter 2: Adding Raster Layers</em><br>\n<em>Chapter 3: Working with Vector Layers</em><br>\n<em>Chapter 4: Working with Events</em><br>\n<em>Chapter 5: Adding Controls</em><br>\n<em>Chapter 6: Theming</em><br>\n<em>Chapter 7: Styling Features</em><br>\n<em>Chapter 8: Beyond the Basics</em></p>\n<p>The chapter organization tries to follow the <em>natural</em> set of step required to learn OpenLayers from the beginning. Chapter 1 introduces the map related concepts, how it contains layers and how they can be handled. Chapters 2 and 3 shows how to work with the two kinds of layers: raster and vector. Chapters 4 and 5 describe the importance of events in web applications, the mechanism offered by OpenLayers and the main set of controls the framework implements. The chapters 6 and 7 are centered on changing the look and feel of our maps in addition to improve the look of vector features. Finally, the chapter 8 show some advanced concepts on how we can extend OpenLayers.</p>\n<p>The process of writing a book is really complex and in addition to the author (that is me) many other people are related to it. By this reason, I would like to thank to the people at <a href=\"http://www.packtpub.com/openlayers-create-gis-web-applications-cookbook/book\">Packt Publishing</a>: <em>Usha Iyer</em>, <em>Kedar Bhat</em>, <em>Joel Goveya</em>, <em>Joyslita Dsouza</em> and <em>Madhuri Das</em> (sorry if I miss someone), to my awesome reviewers: <em>David Burgoon</em>, <em>Mohammad Motamedi</em> (thanks Mohammad for your great review), <em>Jorge Sanz</em>, <em>Srinivas Shanmugam</em>, <em>Davor Zelic</em> and <em>Richard Zijlstra</em>, to my own folks who always encourage me and, most important, to my wife who suffers my addiction to computer science.</p>\n<p>Finally, thanks to all the readers of the book. I hope the book was what they expect from it.</p>\n<p>No doubt to write here asking for help. Thanks to all !!!</p>\n<h3>Other materials</h3>\n<p>Book is accompanied by a RIA application (implemented with the <a href=\"http://dojotoolkit.org/\">Dojo Toolkit</a>) allowing to run and show all the recipes of the book.
