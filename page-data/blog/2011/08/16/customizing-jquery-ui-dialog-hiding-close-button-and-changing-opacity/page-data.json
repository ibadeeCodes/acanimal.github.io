Ok, stop talking with buggy sentences and talk about this post. Recently I was working in a web page using jQuery UI dialogs that have a couple of special requirements that takes me some time and because this I want to share here with you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some dialogs must not have a close button. There are dialogs that must be always visible floating at some part with some controls.</li>\n<li>Some dialogs must have a degree of opacity allowing view the underlaying content and becomes more opaque when the cursor enters in the dialog.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next are samples about how customize minimally the dialog to achieve the previous requirements. You can see them in action in <a href=\"http://acuriousanimal.com/code/jquery_custom_dialog/\">the next sample page</a>.</p>\n<h3>Creating a default dialog</h3>\n<p>Create a default jQuery UI dialog is easy, given a '<em>div</em>' element identified by <em>d1</em>:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush:js\">$(\"#d1\").dialog({\n\tposition: 'left'\n});</pre>\n<h3>Creating a dialog without close button</h3>\n<p>To creating a dialog without a close button, the key is the '<a href=\"http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#event-open\">open</a>' method. We need to reference the '.ui-dialog-titlebar-close' element and hide it:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush:js\">$(\"#d2\").dialog({\n\tposition: 'center',\n\tcloseOnEscape: false,\n\topen: function(event, ui) {\n\t\t// Hide close button\n\t\t$(this).parent().children().children(\".ui-dialog-titlebar-close\").hide();\n\t}\n});</pre>\n<h3>Creating a dialog that changes opacity</h3>\n<p>Finally to create a fashion dialog that changes its opacity with the mouse hover event:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush:js\">\n$(\"#d3\").dialog({\n\tposition: 'right',\n\tcloseOnEscape: false,\n\topen: function(event, ui) {\n\t\t// Set opacity\n\t\t$(this).parent().css('opacity', 0.6);\n\t\t// Hide close button\n\t\t$(this).parent().children().children(\".ui-dialog-titlebar-close\").hide();\n\t\t// Handle opacity\n\t\t$(this).parent().hover( function () {\n\t\t\t$(this).css('opacity', 0.9);\n\t\t}, function (event) {\n\t\t\t$(this).css('opacity', 0.6);\n\t\t});\n\t}\n});\n</pre>\n<p>Do yo know how to create more stunning dialogs?<br />\nComments are welcome. </p>","excerpt":"Sometimes when you are programming small things are the hard things, little details becomes difficult to solve and you need to spend lot of time to solve them.
